            <h2>To a Wreath of Snow</h2>
            <h3>By Emily Brontë</h3>
            <pre>
O transient <span class="winter-highlight-word">voyager</span> of <span class="winter-highlight-word light-dark-highlight-word">heaven!</span>
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ O silent sign of <span class="winter-highlight-word">winter</span> <span class="winter-highlight-word light-dark-highlight-word">skies!</span>
What adverse <span class="winter-highlight-word">wind</span> thy <span class="winter-highlight-word">sail</span> has <span class="winter-highlight-word">driven</span>
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ To <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">dungeons</span> where a prisoner lies?

Methinks the hands that shut the <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">sun</span>
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠So sternly from this <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">morning's</span> <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">brow</span>
Might still their rebel task have done
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ And checked a thing so frail as thou.

They would have done it had they known
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠The talisman that dwelt in thee,
For all the <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">suns</span> that ever <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">shone</span>
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠Have never been so kind to me!

For many a week, and many a <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">day</span>
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ My heart was weighed with sinking <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">gloom</span>
When <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">morning</span> <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">rose</span> in mourning <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">grey</span>
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ And <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">faintly</span> <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">lit</span> my prison room

But <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">angel</span> like, when I awoke,
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ Thy <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">silvery</span> form, so soft and <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">fair</span>
 <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">Shining</span> through <span class="light-dark-highlight-word">darkness,</span> sweetly spoke
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ Of <span class="winter-highlight-word light-dark-highlight-word">cloudy</span> <span class="winter-highlight-word light-dark-highlight-word">skies</span> and <span class="winter-highlight-word">mountains</span> <span class="winter-highlight-word">bare;</span>

The dearest to a <span class="winter-highlight-word">mountaineer</span>
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ Who, all life long has loved the <span class="winter-highlight-word">snow</span>
That <span class="winter-highlight-word">crowned</span> his native <span class="winter-highlight-word">summits</span> <span class="winter-highlight-word light-dark-highlight-word">drear,</span>
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠Better, than greenest plains below.

And voiceless, soulless, messenger
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠Thy presence waked a thrilling tone
That comforts me while thou art here
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠And will sustain when thou art gone
