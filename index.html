            <h2>To a Wreath of Snow</h2>
            <h3>By Emily Brontë</h3>
            <pre>
O transient voyager of heaven!
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ O silent sign of winter skies!
What adverse wind thy sail has driven
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ To dungeons where a prisoner lies?

Methinks the hands that shut the sun
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠So sternly from this morning's brow
Might still their rebel task have done
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ And checked a thing so frail as thou.

They would have done it had they known
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠The talisman that dwelt in thee,
For all the suns that ever shone
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠Have never been so kind to me!

For many a week, and many a day
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ My heart was weighed with sinking gloom
When morning rose in mourning grey
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ And faintly lit my prison room

But angel like, when I awoke,
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ Thy silvery form, so soft and fair
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ Of cloudy skies and mountains bare;

The dearest to a mountaineer
 ⁠⁠ ⁠ ⁠ Who, all life long has loved the snow
That crowned his native summits drear,
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠Better, than greenest plains below.

And voiceless, soulless, messenger
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠Thy presence waked a thrilling tone
That comforts me while thou art here
 ⁠ ⁠ ⁠ ⁠And will sustain when thou art gone
            </pre>
